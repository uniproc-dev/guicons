//! Phase 1 of loading a manifest: **discover** the `[link].includes` file
//! graph, without doing any of the semantic work ([`crate::parse`]'s job)
//! that turns a file's contents into entries/providers. This is the only
//! place that walks the filesystem or decides which files exist and how
//! they relate - [`crate::load`] (phase 2, "compile") only ever walks the
//! [`ManifestGraph`] this module hands it, never touches `fs::` itself,
//! and never resolves an `includes = [...]` path on its own.
//!
//! Splitting it this way means the two phases can't accidentally end up
//! with different ideas of which files exist or how they nest - there is
//! exactly one place that answers that question, and it produces a single
//! artifact the compile phase treats as ground truth.
